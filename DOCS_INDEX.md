## Quick Reference by Goal

### Goal: "I want to understand what was built"
→ Start with **DIAGRAM.txt** (5 min), then **ARCHITECTURE.md** (30 min)

### Goal: "I want to get expert feedback"
→ Share **REVIEW_FOR_OPUS.md** with Claude Opus 4.5

### Goal: "I have new intelligence data"
→ Read **WORKFLOW_UPDATE.md**, then provide data to Claude Code

### Goal: "I want to run the simulation"
→ Read **README.md** for usage instructions

### Goal: "I want to understand the code"
→ Read **ARCHITECTURE.md** sections 2-3, then dive into `src/simulation.py`

## Suggested Reading Order

**For first-time readers:**
1. SUMMARY_FOR_USER.md (this is you)
2. DIAGRAM.txt (quick visual)
3. README.md (how to use)
4. ARCHITECTURE.md (deep dive)

**For reviewers (Opus 4.5):**
1. REVIEW_FOR_OPUS.md (targeted questions)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md (context)
3. src/simulation.py (code)

**For ongoing work:**
1. WORKFLOW_UPDATE.md (when new intel arrives)
2. README.md (reference for commands)
3. outputs/priors_qa.json (check for issues)

---

## Maintenance

**When to update documentation:**
- Major architectural changes → Update ARCHITECTURE.md
- New features → Update README.md
- Code refactoring → Update inline comments
- Bug fixes → Update ARCHITECTURE.md "Bugs Fixed" section
- New questions for Opus → Update REVIEW_FOR_OPUS.md

**Version control:**
- Tag major doc updates: `git tag -a docs-v1.0 -m "Initial complete documentation"`
- Keep docs in sync with code (CI check?)

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** Complete and current
**Next Review:** After Opus 4.5 feedback
